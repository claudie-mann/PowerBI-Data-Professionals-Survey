## Premise
The goal of completing this project is to consolidate and showcase PowerBI skills. The entire project was completed on PowerBI only, therefore, data cleaning was performed with consideration of Power Query's limitations in comparison to Excel or SQL. 

## Process

### 1. Import & Transform - Power Query
- Deleted empty columns from 'Browser' to 'Refer' inclusive
- Standardised answers to Q1, Q4, Q5, and Q11 by performing split column by respective delimiter
- Transform answers to Q3 (yearly salary) to numeric value by splitting the column and calculate the medium

### 2. Visualisation Building
- Added titled to dashboard
- Added cards for displaying key numerics: number of participants and their average age
- Added stacked bar chart to display average annual salary by job titles

## Conclusions
